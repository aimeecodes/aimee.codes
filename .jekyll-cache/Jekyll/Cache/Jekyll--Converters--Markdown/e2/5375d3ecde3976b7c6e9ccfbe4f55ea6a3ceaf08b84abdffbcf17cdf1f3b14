I"D<p>Greetings! After completing my Mandarin exams at the end of January, I was invited to work on a data project with some fellow analysts and machine learning beginners. Together, across 5 separate time zones in 5 separate countries, we developed some self-taught skills:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use PyTorch to create deep learning models</li>
  <li>Self-educate how RNN / LSTM models work</li>
</ul>

<p>Our challenge (and the focus of this post): the (now closed) <a href="https://www.bookingchallenge.com/">Booking.com</a> WSDM Data Challenge. From the website itself, a short summary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thanks to the anonymization,</p>
