I"ô4<p>Â•Ω‰πÖ‰∏çËßÅ‰∫ÜÔºÅ Long time, no see! In my last post, I gave a long update of tasks I took on after moving my little family to a new apartment in a new city. Now that we‚Äôve settled into the new place and my language classes have become a familiar process, I‚Äôve gotten back into the data science swing and returned to the Iowa housing data set.</p>

<p>[If you want to see my work so far on this dataset, click the tags above and you can see all related posts.]</p>

<p>Now, as I‚Äôve been working with this dataset, I‚Äôve run into an interesting problem that I wanted to dedicate a blog post to: filling an NA value with the mode of a series based on a single feature‚Äôs row value (yikes!). To illustrate this, let‚Äôs get a quick background to the problem:</p>

<p>Our dataset has some missing values, and I want to create a ‚Äúrule‚Äù to fill in the NAs. The feature I‚Äôm currently concerned with is ‚Äò<code>MSZoning</code>‚Äô, which only 4 samples from our test_data set are missing.</p>

<p>From the official dataset description file, we get some clues about what <code>MSZoning</code> represents:</p>

<pre>MSZoning: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.
		
       A	Agriculture
       C	Commercial
       FV	Floating Village Residential
       I	Industrial
       RH	Residential High Density
       RL	Residential Low Density
       RP	Residential Low Density Park 
       RM	Residential Medium Density </pre>

<p>Looks like it represents a general idea of what the property is used for. Now we can go ahead and pull some more information about our properties with missing values out of the dataframe:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data[test_data['MSZoning'].isna()][['Id', 'MSZoning', 'Neighborhood', 'MSSubClass', 'Utilities', 'LotConfig']] 

        Id MSZoning Neighborhood  MSSubClass Utilities LotConfig
455   1916      NaN       IDOTRR          30    AllPub    Inside
756   2217      NaN       IDOTRR          20    AllPub    Inside
790   2251      NaN       IDOTRR          70    AllPub    Inside
1444  2905      NaN      Mitchel          20    AllPub    Inside

</pre>

<p>I have some options: first, I could simply fill in the NAs by hand (there are only 4 of them). This way, I have complete control over the values, and I can use whatever logic I want in order to fill them.</p>

<p>Secondly, I could write a rule for the pandas <code>fillna</code> function. This is by far the more interesting approach, since it allows for scalability and application of <code>groupby / agg / apply / transform</code> functions. My difficulty here (and what this post will focus on) is how to pass my desired logic into the <code>fillna</code> function.</p>

<p>To begin, it is worthwhile looking at the by-hand method to understand what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish here.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Option 1: By-Hand</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I want to draw attention to is the most common <code>MSZoning</code> variable. We can check the mode of both datasets, and get a quick summary:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; train_data['MSZoning'].value_counts()
RL         1151
RM          218
FV           65
RH           16
C (all)      10</pre>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data['MSZoning'].value_counts()
RL         1114
RM          242
FV           74
C (all)      15
RH           10</pre>

<p>So, the two datasets definitely share a mode: <code>RL</code>. However, if we divide our dataset into neighborhoods and then count up each <code>MSZoning</code> value, we see a new trend emerge:</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/MSZoning-by-Neighborhood.png" width="110%" /></center>
<p>(Note that only 8 of 25 neighborhoods are included here for ease of viewing, you can see the full figure with all 25 neighborhoods <a href="/assets/images/MSZoning-by-Neighborhood-all.png">here</a>)</p>

<p>My biggest take-aways from this graphic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each neighborhood only has 1-3 unique <code>MSZoning</code> values.</li>
  <li>Some neighborhoods do not share the overall mode of the dataset!</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, in the Somerset Neighborhood the mode is actually <code>FV</code> or Floating Village Residential, and in the IDOTRR (Iowa Department of Transport and Rail Road) Neighborhood the mode is <code>RM</code>, or Residential Medium Density. Since 3 of our 4 homes are in the IDOTRR Neighborhood, we should be careful about filling NAs with the mode of the overall dataset.</p>

<p>The easiest thing is to hand-fill the NAs based on the <em>mode</em> of the subset of the Neighborhood. This is pretty simple, and the only snag we hit is dealing with indices (non-trivial!) if we merged our datasets, or adjusted their positions in anyway.</p>

<p>Thus, for the 3 properties without <code>MSZoning</code> in IDOTRR, we will replace the NA with ‚ÄòRM‚Äô, and the property in Mitchel will be replaced with ‚ÄòRL‚Äô.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[455, 'MSZoning'] = 'RM'
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[756, 'MSZoning'] = 'RM'
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[790, 'MSZoning'] = 'RM'
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[1444, 'MSZoning'] = 'RL'</pre>

<p>Again, note here that I had to find the indices and access each value by hand. This is fine for a small number of fixes, but I need a way to automate this process so I can reuse the logical structure in a larger setting!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Option 2: Automation</strong></p>

<p>My general idea here is to pass the same kind of hand-checked logic to the fillna function: if this sample has an NA for <code>MSZoning</code>, calculate the most common <code>MSZoning</code> value for all homes with the sample‚Äôs Neighborhood value, and then assign the most common value.</p>

<p>While researching how I could attempt this, I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51117932">this</a> answer on stackoverflow; this gave me some great insight into using the pandas function <code>groupby</code>, and how I could adapt it to my problem. First, let‚Äôs see what groupby does if I decide I want to group <code>train_data</code> by <em>Neighborhood</em>, and then see the <em>mean</em> SalePrice, followed by the <em>standard deviation</em> of our SalePrice feature:</p>

<pre># initialize the Series as a DataFrame column
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_saleprice_sum = pd.DataFrame(grouped['SalePrice'].mean())

# add standard deviation as column to dataframe
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_saleprice_sum['StdDev'] = grouped['SalePrice'].std()

# round columns to 2 decimal places
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_saleprice_sum['MeanSalePrice'] = pd.Series([round(val,2) for val in neigh_saleprice_sum['MeanSalePrice']], index = neigh_saleprice_sum.index)

&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_saleprice_sum['StdDev'] = pd.Series([round(val,2) for val in neigh_saleprice_sum['StdDev']], index = neigh_saleprice_sum.index)

&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_saleprice_sum

<p>Awesome - we created a customized summary of SalePrice for each Neighborhood. We could do this kind of summary for any numerical feature in our dataset, grouped specifically by a selected categorical feature.</p>

<p>Now, if we wanted to, we could initialize a SalePrice variable in our test_data set, assign the mean SalePrice of the neighborhood to each test_data sample, and call it a day! Machine Learning‚Ñ¢ Completed. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd get fantastic accuracy though, considering the second column above, so we‚Äôd better keep searching for a better method.</p>

<p>One issue is that there isn‚Äôt a .mode() we can use at the end of our statement - this groupby function only works with numerical summaries, like mean, var, or median. So we need to find a work around, since our data is categorical and we‚Äôre assigning it based on the Neighborhood‚Äôs mode.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; grouped['SalePrice'].mode()
AttributeError: 'SeriesGroupBy' object has no attribute 'mode'</pre>

<p>Thankfully, I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/59127538">another</a> potential answer. This one introduced the idea of bringing <code>transform, agg,</code> and <code>apply</code> into the mix. A great primer for understanding how these function works can be found <a href="https://pbpython.com/pandas_transform.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I found that when I used <code>transform</code>, it had the same limitations as earlier - I couldn‚Äôt use it on categorical variables immediately. However, I found when I used <code>agg</code>, I was able to get some great results! Below, we‚Äôre going to find the most common value for <code>MSZoning</code> sorted by <code>Neighborhood</code>.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; merge_data.groupby('Neighborhood')['MSZoning'].agg(pd.Series.mode)

<p>This is a great sign - it‚Äôs returning the most common value of <code>MSZoning</code> for each <code>Neighborhood</code>! As we saw earlier, the most common <code>MSZoning</code> value for the <code>Neighborhood</code> of ‚ÄòSomerset‚Äô is indeed <code>FV</code>. Now that we have something that works, I want to walk through my logic before we jump into writing the code that works.</p>

<p>My first thought: I could simply calculate this variable and assign it as a column for every single sample in our test data, so it‚Äôs a fast and easy fix to simply assign a missing sample‚Äôs calculated mode as it‚Äôs <code>MSZoning</code> value. However, let‚Äôs remember: there are 1459 samples in my <code>test_data</code> set. I‚Äôm not going to waste time creating an additional, useless variable for 1455 samples. This is not great for scalability, and a huge waste of my computer‚Äôs limited processing power.</p>

<p>Instead, we‚Äôre going to use the pandas <code>fillna</code> function, which should have an easier time detecting NAs in our selected column, and doing minor computations to fill.</p>

<p>The function <code>fillna</code> can take a function, which will execute when an NA passes in. Let‚Äôs take a look at the code below:</p>

<pre>for ds in (test_data, train_data, merge_data):
	ds['MSZoning'] = ds['MSZoning'].fillna(ds.groupby('Neighborhood')['MSZoning'].transform(lambda x: x.mode().iloc[0]))</pre>

<p>Here, you‚Äôll notice I have three datasets: these are my training samples which I‚Äôll train my model on; testing samples which I‚Äôll use to test the accuracy of my model; and a merged dataset of my test and training data, minus our target variable (<code>SalePrice</code>), which I‚Äôm using to fill in and summarize the data.</p>

<p>As well, you‚Äôll notice I passed in a lambda function: here, I‚Äôm asking it to assign the mode of the <code>MSZoning</code> feature, grouped by <code>Neighborhood</code>. After this code runs, we can check to see if any NAs remain in our data sets, and check the assigned variables at our indices:</p>

<pre># check to make sure no more NAs exist for this variable
&gt;&gt;&gt; for ds in (test_data, train_data, merge_data):
	print(ds[ds['MSZoning'].isna()])

Empty DataFrame

Empty DataFrame

Empty DataFrame

</pre>

<p>So far, so good - let‚Äôs see what the values are at our previously NA locations:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[455, 'MSZoning']
'RM'

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[756, 'MSZoning']
'RM'

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[790, 'MSZoning']
'RM'

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_data.at[1444, 'MSZoning']
'RL'</pre>

<p>Great, it works exactly like it ought to! You can find my full cleaning script posted on my <a href="">Github</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Final Results</strong></p>

<p>Using <code>groupby, transform</code> and a lambda function, I was able to fill in categorical NAs based on the mode of another categorical variable, by grouping the dataset by <em>another</em> categorical variable. This way, I can write two short lines of code into my prerun cleaning script, and get to working with more accurate data. Another variable I‚Äôll use this kind of prediction on is <code>Exterior1st / Exterior2nd</code>, since these features also seem to correlate with <code>Neighborhood</code>.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs all for today‚Äôs post, I‚Äôll have another large update to post when I‚Äôve finished cleaning my dataset and prepared it for algorithm testing. Until next time, stay safe and wear a mask!</p>
