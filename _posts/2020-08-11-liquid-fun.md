OH BOY! Since my last update, I\'ve had the following progression of tasks:
<ol>
	<li>Add responsive CSS, so layout will change based on screen size (If you're viewing this on mobile, apologies - I'm working on it!</li>
	<li>Install new Jekyll website theme</li>
	<li>Add Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to website files</li>
	<li>Add project environment level package control</li>
	<li>Install nix for package control</li>
	<li>Move all data off harddrive via scp</li>
	<li>Create password bank and generate new passwords for all accounts</li>
	<li>Re-generate SSH and GPG keys</li>
	<li>Move OS from Catalina to Ubuntu</li>
	<li>Reconfigure entire workflow</li>
	<li>Add tags to posts and create tag-filtered page (thank you <a href="http://jrper.github.io/2018/04/03/AddingTags.html">James</a>!)</li>
</ol>

...so you could say that I\'ve had quite the week. To summarize my experiences, I\'m extremely happy with the move to Ubuntu (you can customize <i>everything!</i>), I have a stronger understanding of the need for package control (and how nix helps you do this - I love lying to my computer...), and I really do not think javascript is necessary for a satisfying website experience (no offense to any webdevs out there, but it's just not for me). Next up: figuring out responsive CSS, and configuring my blog so mobile viewing is not a huge pain.

Until next time!
